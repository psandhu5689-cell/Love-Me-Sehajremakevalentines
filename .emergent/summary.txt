<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: 
The user's initial request was to get the code and navigation pathway for the daily hub love page and the this or that button. This evolved into a series of feature requests and redesigns for a web application.

The current and most recent task is to add three new games under the Try Not To Smile menu:
1.  **Roast Roulette**: A game where the user gets a playful roast and a comforting line.
2.  **Love Court**: A mini-trial game with absurd cases and funny verdicts.
3.  **Reaction Jail**: A fast-paced reflex game based on prompts.

Previously, the user requested and the agent completed:
-   Multiple redesigns of the  page.
-   A complete redesign of the  page.
-   A major expansion of the Valentines Sequence with 8 new interactive pages.
-   Implementation of a global UI sound system.
-   The user also asked to integrate all changes into a provided GitHub repository, explicitly stating not to touch the  file. The agent's attempt to push the changes failed due to an authentication error, and the user asked to cancel the Git operation and resume the development tasks.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a Vercel-targeted React web application (). The agent has performed multiple UI/UX enhancements and feature additions. Key completed work includes a redesigned Daily Love Hub, a redesigned How Long Together page, an expanded Valentines Sequence with 8 new pages, and a global UI sound system. The codebase relies heavily on hardcoded content from  for its personalized feel. The agent has just started the latest task of creating three new games.

-   The files for , , and  were part of a previous request that was superseded. The agent created . These features should either be fully implemented or the placeholder files removed after clarifying with the user.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **DO NOT TOUCH **. The user has been extremely clear about this. This file is known to be fragile and has caused build failures in the past.
-   The user's requests change frequently. The current highest priority is to finish the three new games (, , ).
-   All UI text and content should be inspired by or pulled from  to match the established Prabh voice.
-   The GitHub integration task was aborted by the user. Do not attempt to commit or push to a remote repository unless the user explicitly re-requests it.
